Hello!


This is for me, don't look, frl.

    Open the Terminal in VS Code:
        Press Ctrl + backtick

Check the Git status:
    git status

Add changes to the staging area:
    git add .

Or, if you want to add specific files:
    git add filename

Commit the changes:
    git commit -m "Your commit message here"

Pull the latest changes (if necessary):
    git pull origin branch-name

Push the changes:
    git push origin branch-name


After these steps, your changes will be pushed to the remote repository.

    Note: If you haven't set up Git or configured your remote repository, you'll need to do so first. Use the following commands to set up Git initially:

    git init
    git remote add origin your_remote_repository_url
